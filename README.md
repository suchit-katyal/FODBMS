**Project 1**

**Case-Study** : The main objective of this project is to design a payroll management
system which will maintain record of all the employees within an organization
like salary/bonus calculation, annual performance score, personal records, job departments,
leaves etc. Each stakeholder has limited rights in the system as per their role. Every payroll 
will have a unique id (just like a receipt no.). Employee will get payroll every month.

**Tools Used** : Oracle VM VirtualBox, Ubuntu, MySQL, MS Excel and WorkBench

**Key stakeholders involved in this project are as follows :**
1. Employees : Employees currently working in the organization.
2. Admin (HR Team) : HR Team working in the payroll department of the organization.
3. Senior Manager : Respective senior managers of the employees who evaluate their performance.
4. DBA (Database Analyst) : Database analyst who will design the whole payroll management system.

**Different tables that will be created are as follows :**

1. Employee : This table will contain various details of employees currently working in the organization.
2. Payroll : Details included in this table will be related to all the essential components of payroll.
3. Job Department : This will include details of all the departments in the organization.
4. Salary : All the components of salary will be included in this table.

6. Annual Performance Score (APS) : This table will include the details of performance by each 
   employee and how their managers graded them.
